Code for the control of the biosensor device

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recorded 219 million cases of malaria in 2017 with an estimated death count of 435,000. Treatment with combination therapies involving artemisinin and its derivatives (henceforth collectively referred to as ART) is a critical factor for effective interventions.
However, previous studieshave shown that 38â€“52% of ACTs sold in Southeast Asia were counterfeit or substandard (defined as containing less than 85% of the active pharmaceutical ingredient advertised). Substandard medicines have also contributed to developing resistance as they encourage overuse.

The need to authenticate artemisinin-containing antimalarials at the point of care is therefore evident.
